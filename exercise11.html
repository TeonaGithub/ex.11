            <h2>about</h2>
            
            <p>Ego has no place in the design process. Fail quickly to succeed quickly.<br>
                Negative feedback is a gift. Universal design is ethical design.<br>
                Designers are toolmakers.<br>
                Meet people where they are. Be a facilitator.<br>
                Define the problem. Play. There's always more than one solution.<br>
                Empathy is the key to resonance. You are not your user.</p>
